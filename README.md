# Data-Science-Project
## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others.
A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.

## Creating the model

To create the prediction app I started using the --[Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip), and doing some preprocessing on data such as removing punctuations and numbers. After that I used NLP to create the model aka tokenizing the data.

## Prediction

To predict the next word the app will get a phrase from the user and based on the number of words entered it will use NLP algorithm and gives a result
